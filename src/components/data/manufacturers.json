      "description": "We were captivated by the flying disc craze of the 1970's. To interact with a spinning disc and watch it fly is truly a beautiful thing. Our frustration at the time was over the quality of the discs that were available; flight patterns were inconsistent, distance potential was low, and the quality in general was poor. Those discs were manufactured to be toys, and we wanted high performance sports equipment to keep up with the increasing skills of the players.",
